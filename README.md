CODE Competition 


Hello Code Judges.

First of all thanks for your efforts in this amazing competition. 

For our files, we have attached The WIndows Communication Foundation (WCF) web srervice that talks to the Database. 
We use the Webservice to feed a website called wwww.connect4help.com which is already up and running and for a Windows 
phone Application that has more functionalities than the website. You can find the XAP file in the bin or in the uploaded
version of the project on your website.

The Dataset used is described in the description on the entry submission page.

The DataInsertion program is used to clean our data and insert it in our database. 

Thanks

E-Miner Team
